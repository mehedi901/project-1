    Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hats who dreams of becoming the King of the Pirates and finding One Piece. Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no devil fruit when he was 7 and it turned his body into rubber. Luffy got his straw hat from Shanks, which he gave to him as a gift.
    He is the son of the Revolutionary Army Lead Monkey D. Dragon and the grandson of the Marine Vice Admiral Monkey D. Garp. His grandad, father, brother, Portgas D. Ace and himself are a few of the people who carry the Will of D. Luffy has fought a lot of people over the course of the anime starting from pirates of the East Blue to even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line. Luffy has accomplished a lot of things and this has given him a nickname as a Dangerous Future Element.
